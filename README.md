# The Grand Unified Theory of The Haunted Cosmos
This is my log of the various episodes and theories presented in the Haunted Cosmos and Dusty Tome podcasts, hosted by Ben and Brian, in the form of an Obsidian Vault.
The repo will be updated the Saturday after every episode's release and you can update your copies of it from here.
